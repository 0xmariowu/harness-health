# Changelog

## v0.1.4 (2026-04-04)

You can now see what needs fixing before choosing. Scanner finds nested repos.

- Fix plan prints a readable summary before asking which items to fix (was hidden in collapsed output)
- Scanner discovers projects up to 3 levels deep (was 1 — missed nested repos)
- Fix: plan-generator now includes score in output items (was dropped, showed as -1)
- Fix: severity thresholds in docs now match code (<0.5 = high)
- Fix: 3 security workflows using nonexistent actions/checkout@v6
- Fix: broken reference to docs/evidence-sources.md in README
- Cleaned internal development notes
- Cleaned .gitignore, package.json, hardcoded paths
- Upgraded issue templates to YAML form format
- Added Dependabot grouped updates
- Added 10 fixer.js tests (auto-fix, assisted, guided, backup)
- Suppressed 17 Semgrep false positives (path-traversal on local CLI tool)
- All CI checks green (24 tests, shellcheck, semgrep, gitleaks, trivy)

## v0.1.3 (2026-04-03)

Fix: plugin was not discoverable — missing marketplace.json.

- You can now actually install with `extraKnownMarketplaces` + `enabledPlugins`
- Fix: added `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (tells Claude Code this repo is a marketplace with a plugin)

## v0.1.2 (2026-04-03)

Fix: `/hh` is a user command, not an internal skill.

- You can now `/hh` in any Claude Code session after install
- Fix: moved `skills/hh/SKILL.md` → `commands/hh.md` (command = user-invocable, skill = internal)
- Fix: simplified plugin.json to match official plugins (name + description + author only)
- Fix: added `allowed-tools` to command frontmatter

## v0.1.1 (2026-04-03)

Fix: plugin format was wrong, users couldn't install from GitHub.

- You can now install via `extraKnownMarketplaces` and it actually works
- Fix: moved `plugin.json` to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- Fix: moved `skills/hh.md` to `skills/hh/SKILL.md` (directory format)
- Fix: removed explicit skills array from plugin.json (auto-discovered)

## v0.1.0 (2026-04-03)

First release. You can now:

- Run `/hh` in Claude Code to diagnose all your projects
- See a score out of 100 across 4 dimensions (Findability, Instructions, Workability, Continuity)
- Get a fix plan grouped by severity with auto/assisted/guided actions
- Execute fixes automatically (broken references, missing files) or get guidance
- Optionally run AI Deep Analysis to find contradictions, dead-weight rules, and vague rules
- Optionally run Session Analysis to find repeated instructions and friction patterns

### Technical

- 20 evidence-backed checks (scanner.sh)
- Weighted scoring algorithm (scorer.js)
- Fix plan generator with severity grouping and item merging (plan-generator.js)
