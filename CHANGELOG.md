# Changelog

## v0.1.3 (2026-04-03)

Fix: plugin was not discoverable — missing marketplace.json.

- You can now actually install with `extraKnownMarketplaces` + `enabledPlugins`
- Fix: added `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (tells Claude Code this repo is a marketplace with a plugin)

## v0.1.2 (2026-04-03)

Fix: `/hh` is a user command, not an internal skill.

- You can now `/hh` in any Claude Code session after install
- Fix: moved `skills/hh/SKILL.md` → `commands/hh.md` (command = user-invocable, skill = internal)
- Fix: simplified plugin.json to match official plugins (name + description + author only)
- Fix: added `allowed-tools` to command frontmatter

## v0.1.1 (2026-04-03)

Fix: plugin format was wrong, users couldn't install from GitHub.

- You can now install via `extraKnownMarketplaces` and it actually works
- Fix: moved `plugin.json` to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- Fix: moved `skills/hh.md` to `skills/hh/SKILL.md` (directory format)
- Fix: removed explicit skills array from plugin.json (auto-discovered)
